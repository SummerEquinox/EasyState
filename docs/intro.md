# Getting Started

EasyState is a lightweight, type-safe state container class designed specifically for Roblox development. It provides a simple yet powerful way to manage state across your Roblox applications with several key features that make it stand out:

- **Subscription System**: Built-in subscription mechanism that allows components to react to state changes efficiently
- **Memory Efficient**: Optimized for performance with minimal overhead
- **Simple API**: Intuitive methods like `Get()`, `Set()`, `Subscribe()`, and `Reset()` make state management straightforward
- **Flexible Value Types**: Supports numbers, strings, booleans, and tables as state values
- **Subscription Control**: Advanced features like `SubscribeUntil()` and `UnsubscribeUntil()` give you fine-grained control over state subscriptions
- **State Persistence**: Maintains original values and provides easy reset functionality

Whether you're building a complex game system or a simple UI component, EasyState provides the tools you need to manage state effectively while maintaining code clarity and performance. I wanted a solution which could be applicable to many situations.
